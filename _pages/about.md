Hi! I'm Ipek, a recent PhD graduate in Biochemistry from CUNY Advanced Science Research Center. I defended my dissertation in June 2025 on how TET2 regulates RNA modifications in brain cells—a project that taught me as much about perseverance as it did about molecular biology.

I love the challenge of bridging wet lab and computational work. My days in grad school went from pipetting at the bench to analyzing terabytes of sequencing data in R and Python.

Outside the lab, I'm passionate about making computational concepts accessible to biologists. I'm building tutorials to help bridge that gap. I also love mentoring undergraduate students from my alma mater in Turkey, helping them navigate their own scientific journeys.

When I'm not thinking about chromatin or writing code, you'll find me with my cats Bomi and Yulaf (yes, I'm one of *those* scientists). My husband Arda is a dermatology resident, so our dinner conversations are… eclectic.

I'm currently seeking positions in computational biology, bioinformatics, scientific editing, or postdoctoral research where I can combine rigorous data analysis with clear science communication.

**What I bring:** Chromatin biology expertise • Multi-omics integration • R & Python fluency • Science communication • A genuine excitement for making complex biology understandable
