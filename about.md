I am a recent PhD graduate passionate about epigenetics, and molecular biology. I’m actively learning *bioinformatics* to bridge wet-lab insight with reproducible computational analysis.

**Skills snapshot**  
- Wet lab: cloning, cell culture, PCR/qPCR, CRISPR workflows, basic library prep.  
- Computational: R, tidyverse, Bioconductor, Python (pandas), UNIX/bash, Git/GitHub.  
- Writing & editing: scientific summaries, figure legends, manuscript structuring.

**Why this site?** To **motivate myself** by tracking progress publicly—small wins, clear notes, and steady iteration.
