I am a recent PhD graduate passionate about epigenetics and molecular biology. I am actively learning *bioinformatics* to bridge wet-lab insight with reproducible computational analysis.

**Skills snapshot**  
- Wet lab: molecular cloning, cell culture, PCR/qPCR, CRISPR workflows, Western blotting, 
- Computational: R (Bioconductor), Python, UNIX/bash, Git/GitHub.  
- Writing & editing: scientific summaries, figure legends, manuscript structuring.

**Why this site?** To **motivate myself** by tracking progress publiclyâ€”small wins, clear notes, and steady iteration.
