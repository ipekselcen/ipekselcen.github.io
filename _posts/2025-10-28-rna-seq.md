If you've ever stared at an Excel file with 20,000 rows and thought "I have no idea if this is right anymore," this post is for you. Here's a confession: I once spent an entire afternoon trying to figure out if I'd accidentally shifted all my gene names off from their expression values. I hadn't. But I couldn't be sure.
