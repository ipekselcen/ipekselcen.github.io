Today I launched my new professional portfolio site! This is the first step in my journey to transition into bioinformatics and scientific editorial roles.

## Why This Site?

I wanted a place to:
- Showcase my chromatin biology research
- Demonstrate my computational skills
- Track my progress publicly
- Connect with potential collaborators and employers

## Technical Stack

The site uses a hybrid approach:
- Custom HTML/CSS for the main portfolio
- Jekyll for blog functionality
- Hosted on GitHub Pages

## Next Steps

- Add my publications
- Write about my ChIP-seq analysis pipeline
- Document my journey learning new bioinformatics tools
- Share insights from reading papers

Small wins, clear notes, and steady iteration!
