Started working on an automated ChIP-seq analysis pipeline today. This is part of my journey to master chromatin biology data analysis.

## Pipeline Goals

Create a reproducible workflow for:
- Quality control (FastQC, MultiQC)
- Read alignment (Bowtie2)
- Peak calling (MACS2)
- Differential binding analysis
- Visualization in R

## Current Progress

Today I set up the basic structure:

```bash
# Project structure
chip-seq-pipeline/
├── scripts/
│   ├── 01_qc.sh
│   ├── 02_align.sh
│   └── 03_peaks.sh
├── config/
└── README.md
```

## Next Steps

- Implement quality control step
- Test with public datasets
- Add visualization module
- Document everything!

Code will be on GitHub soon. Follow along!
