I built this site to motivate myself as I transition from a wet‑lab focus (molecular biology and epigenetics) into *bioinformatics*.

**Rules I’ll try to follow:**
1. Ship small things weekly (notes, mini‑reviews, or figures).  
2. Prefer clarity over perfection—document steps so future‑me can repeat them.  
3. Keep code and results in public repos when possible.

**Next steps (accountability):**
- Publish a minimal RNA‑seq DE template with `DESeq2` and example plots.  
- Write a 500‑word mini‑review on an epigenetics paper I like.
- Post a cheatsheet on basic UNIX + Git commands I use daily.
