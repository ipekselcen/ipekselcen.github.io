Cell segmentation remains a foundational challenge in quantitative microscopy: accurate delineation of cells directly impacts downstream measurements from morphology to population statistics. Traditional classical methods—thresholding, watershed, edge detection—often require hand-tuning and fail to generalize across imaging modalities, cell types, and contrast conditions. The advent of deep learning offered promise for automated segmentation, but early models typically required large, task-specific annotated datasets and still struggled with out-of-distribution images.
In their 2021 Nature Methods paper, Stringer, Wang, Michaelos and colleagues introduced Cellpose, a generalist deep learning framework trained on a highly diverse corpus of cellular images. Instead of training bespoke models for each image type, Cellpose learns a representation of “cellness” using flow fields that predict how pixels move toward cell centroids. This approach enables robust instance segmentation across fluorescent, phase-contrast, and brightfield images with minimal user intervention. Crucially, pretrained Cellpose models perform well out of the box on a wide range of datasets, significantly lowering the barrier to adoption for biologists without deep learning expertise.
While generalist models like the original Cellpose expand accessibility, they inevitably encounter new data that differ substantially from their training distribution. This limitation motivated the development of Cellpose 2.0 (Nature Methods, 2022), which rethinks generality and adaptability with two key advances: a “model zoo” of pretrained segmentation models capturing diverse annotation styles, and a human-in-the-loop training pipeline enabling rapid dataset-specific customization.
The model zoo leverages the observation that segmentation styles can vary systematically across imaging conditions and user preferences—some annotators emphasize cytoplasmic boundaries, others focus on nuclei or tolerate dense clusters differently. By clustering images based on learned style vectors, Cellpose 2.0 generates ensembles of models tuned to different segmentation styles. Users can either select a pretrained model that best fits their images or automatically assign images to the closest style, yielding performance improvements over a single global model.
Complementing the model zoo, the human-in-the-loop workflow allows researchers to train segmentation models on new data with remarkably little annotation effort. Starting from a pretrained Cellpose model, users iteratively correct segmentation outputs on a few dozen to a few hundred regions of interest. These incremental corrections rapidly refine the model, yielding segmentation quality comparable to models trained on orders of magnitude more annotated data. This interactive pipeline, supported by a graphical annotation interface, transforms model training from a machine learning specialist task into a practical, researcher-driven process.
Together, Cellpose and Cellpose 2.0 represent a shift from static, one-size-fits-all segmentation toward adaptive, human-guided deep learning. The original Cellpose established that diverse training data and flow-based representations enable broad applicability across biological images. Cellpose 2.0 builds on this foundation to give users the tools to customize segmentation behavior efficiently and transparently, bridging the gap between generalist models and dataset-specific performance. These advances have helped Cellpose become one of the most widely adopted segmentation tools in the bioimage analysis ecosystem and continue to influence emerging frameworks for interactive machine learning in microscopy.
