Below are a few example projects. I’ll keep them short and focused on **problem → approach → result**.

### Project: Reproducible RNA‑seq DE pipeline (learning build)
**Problem.** I want a clean template to analyze count data end‑to‑end.  
**Approach.** R (DESeq2), QC (MultiQC), tidyverse, clear README with steps and figures.  
**Result.** A minimal repo with scripts, a Makefile, and example dataset. *(Coming soon—will link GitHub.)*

### Project: 5hmC/epigenetics reading list → blog mini‑reviews
**Problem.** Keep track of papers and improve my synthesis skills.  
**Approach.** Weekly (or biweekly) short blog posts with 3‑5 takeaways each.  
**Result.** Living index and tags; practice for scientific editorial writing.
