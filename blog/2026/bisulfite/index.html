Both are cytosines. Both look identical under a microscope. Both have the same mass on a spectrometer.</p> <p>Her solution—treating DNA with sodium bisulfite to chemically convert unmethylated cytosines to uracils while leaving methylated cytosines untouched—became bisulfite sequencing, the gold standard for measuring DNA methylation. But here’s what’s fascinating: this experimental innovation forced biologists to start thinking computationally, whether they realized it or not.</p> <p>Why? Because bisulfite sequencing doesn’t give you a direct readout of methylation. It gives you sequences full of Ts (converted from unmethylated Cs) and Cs (originally methylated). Someone—or something—has to <strong>infer</strong> the original methylation state by comparing treated to untreated DNA.</p> <blockquote class="block-tip"> <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> That inference step? That’s computational thinking. The moment you have to reconstruct information from transformed data, you’re already doing computation—even if you’re just using Excel.</p> </blockquote> <hr> <h2 id="decomposition-breaking-down-the-methylation-problem">Decomposition: Breaking Down the Methylation Problem</h2> <p>Let’s unpack what bisulfite sequencing actually requires you to do. This is where computational thinking starts: with <strong>decomposition</strong>—breaking a complex problem into manageable pieces.</p> <p><strong>The experimental question:</strong> “What is the methylation status of my genomic region?”</p> <p><strong>The computational breakdown:</strong></p> <ol> <li>Align bisulfite-converted reads to a reference genome (but the reads don’t match perfectly anymore)</li> <li>Identify which Cs became Ts (unmethylated sites)</li> <li>Identify which Cs stayed Cs (methylated sites)</li> <li>Calculate methylation percentage per site</li> <li>Account for incomplete conversion (some Cs don’t convert even if unmethylated)</li> <li>Account for sequencing errors (some Ts might be sequencing mistakes, not conversions)</li> </ol> <p>Each of these is its own computational problem. And here’s the kicker: in the early days, biologists did steps 2-6 by hand, often using Excel. They were doing computational thinking without formal training.</p> <h3 id="the-pattern-recognition-emerges">The Pattern Recognition Emerges</h3> <p>By the mid-2000s, researchers realized they were solving the same alignment problem over and over. Different labs were writing similar scripts. The community needed a standardized tool.</p> <p>Enter <strong>Bismark</strong> (2011), which automated the entire pipeline. But Bismark didn’t just automate existing manual steps—it introduced <strong>abstraction</strong>: the tool could handle single-end or paired-end reads, different reference genomes, various quality filters. One algorithm, many applications.</p> <hr> <h2 id="pattern-recognition-the-chromatin-accessibility-revolution">Pattern Recognition: The Chromatin Accessibility Revolution</h2> <p>Fast forward to 2013. Jason Buenrostro at Stanford develops ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing). Instead of asking “where is DNA methylated?”, he asks “where is chromatin accessible?”</p> <p>The experimental approach is elegantly simple: a hyperactive transposase (Tn5) cuts DNA at accessible regions and simultaneously inserts sequencing adapters. Sequence the fragments, and you have a map of open chromatin.</p> <p>But here’s where <strong>pattern recognition</strong> becomes crucial. ATAC-seq doesn’t just give you a list of open regions. It gives you:</p> <ul> <li>Read depth (how accessible is each region?)</li> <li>Fragment length distribution (are nucleosomes present?)</li> <li>Footprints (protected regions within accessible chromatin where transcription factors bind)</li> </ul> <blockquote class="block-tip"> <p><strong>Pattern Recognition in Action:</strong> Early ATAC-seq papers just counted peaks. Then researchers noticed patterns: certain genomic regions showed stereotypical fragment length distributions. A peak with many ~40-50bp fragments suggested nucleosome-free regions. Longer fragments (~200bp) indicated mononucleosomes.</p> </blockquote> <p>By 2016, tools like <strong>NucleoATAC</strong> were extracting nucleosome positioning and transcription factor occupancy from the same ATAC-seq data, because the patterns were there all along—they just needed algorithms to recognize them systematically.</p> <p>The key insight: ATAC-seq fragment lengths aren’t noise. They’re data. But recognizing that required thinking computationally about what the experimental readout was actually telling you.</p> <hr> <h2 id="algorithmic-thinking-chip-seq-and-the-peak-calling-problem">Algorithmic Thinking: ChIP-seq and the Peak Calling Problem</h2> <p>Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) gives you a pile of DNA fragments representing where your protein of interest was bound. Your challenge: where, exactly, were the binding sites?</p> <p>This is an <strong>algorithmic thinking</strong> problem: given noisy data with background signal, how do you systematically identify true binding events?</p> <h3 id="naive-vs-sophisticated-approaches">Naive vs. Sophisticated Approaches</h3> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>❌ <strong>Naive Algorithm</strong> </th> <th>✅ <strong>Sophisticated Algorithm (MACS2)</strong> </th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>1.

It <strong>models</strong> the data generation process (how reads are created from fragments, how background varies locally) and uses that model to make better inferences.</p> <blockquote class="block-warning"> <p><strong>This is algorithmic thinking:</strong> Designing a step-by-step procedure that accounts for the structure of your problem.</p> </blockquote> <hr> <h2 id="abstraction-single-cell-multi-omics">Abstraction: Single-Cell Multi-Omics</h2> <p>Here’s where epigenetics methods get really interesting computationally.

</code></pre> <p>The computational challenge: these assays measure fundamentally different things. RNA-seq counts molecules. ATAC-seq measures accessibility. Methylation is binary at each CG site.</p> <p><strong>Abstraction to the rescue:</strong> Tools like <strong>Signac</strong> and <strong>ArchR</strong> introduced a unified framework.</p> <p><strong>The Key Abstraction:</strong></p> <p>All single-cell data can be represented as:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Cell × Feature matrix</strong> (what you measure)</li> <li> <strong>Metadata</strong> (cell annotations, quality metrics)</li> <li> <strong>Dimensional reduction</strong> (shared latent space)</li> </ul> <p>Whether you have RNA counts, ATAC peaks, or methylation rates, this framework applies. The computational operations—normalization, feature selection, clustering, visualization—work on the abstract representation, not the raw data type.</p> <p>This is abstraction: identifying common structure across different domains and building tools that work at that level of generality.</p> <hr> <h2 id="the-deep-learning-revolution-when-pattern-recognition-meets-abstraction">The Deep Learning Revolution: When Pattern Recognition Meets Abstraction</h2> <h3 id="2024-the-year-foundation-models-arrived-in-epigenetics">2024: The Year Foundation Models Arrived in Epigenetics</h3> <p>Taskiran et al.

They’ll be the ones who learn to think about biological problems the way Marianne Frommer thought about bisulfite sequencing: <strong>as an inference problem where experimental design and computational analysis are inseparable.</strong></p> <blockquote class="block-tip"> <p><strong>Remember:</strong> When Frommer developed bisulfite sequencing in 1992, she wasn’t trying to teach anyone computational thinking. She was just trying to measure methylation.
