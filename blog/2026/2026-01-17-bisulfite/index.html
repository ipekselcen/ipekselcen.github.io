Both are cytosines. Both look identical under a microscope. Both have the same mass on a spectrometer.</p> <p>Her solution—treating DNA with sodium bisulfite to chemically convert unmethylated cytosines to uracils while leaving methylated cytosines untouched—became bisulfite sequencing, the gold standard for measuring DNA methylation. But here’s what’s fascinating: this experimental innovation forced biologists to start thinking computationally, whether they realized it or not.</p> <p>Why? Because bisulfite sequencing doesn’t give you a direct readout of methylation. It gives you sequences full of Ts (converted from unmethylated Cs) and Cs (originally methylated). Someone—or something—has to <strong>infer</strong> the original methylation state by comparing treated to untreated DNA.</p> <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"> <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> That inference step? That’s computational thinking. The moment you have to reconstruct information from transformed data, you’re already doing computation—even if you’re just using Excel.</p> </div> <hr> <h2 id="decomposition-breaking-down-the-methylation-problem">Decomposition: Breaking Down the Methylation Problem</h2> <p>Let’s unpack what bisulfite sequencing actually requires you to do. This is where computational thinking starts: with <strong>decomposition</strong>—breaking a complex problem into manageable pieces.</p> <p><strong>The experimental question:</strong> “What is the methylation status of my genomic region?”</p> <p><strong>The computational breakdown:</strong></p> <ol> <li>Align bisulfite-converted reads to a reference genome (but the reads don’t match perfectly anymore)</li> <li>Identify which Cs became Ts (unmethylated sites)</li> <li>Identify which Cs stayed Cs (methylated sites)</li> <li>Calculate methylation percentage per site</li> <li>Account for incomplete conversion (some Cs don’t convert even if unmethylated)</li> <li>Account for sequencing errors (some Ts might be sequencing mistakes, not conversions)</li> </ol> <p>Each of these is its own computational problem. And here’s the kicker: in the early days, biologists did steps 2-6 by hand, often using Excel. They were doing computational thinking without formal training.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/bisulfite_workflow-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/bisulfite_workflow-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/bisulfite_workflow-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/bisulfite_workflow.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">Bisulfite sequencing workflow showing experimental and computational steps</figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Note: Replace with actual workflow diagram </div> <h3 id="the-pattern-recognition-emerges">The Pattern Recognition Emerges</h3> <p>By the mid-2000s, researchers realized they were solving the same alignment problem over and over. Different labs were writing similar scripts. The community needed a standardized tool.</p> <p>Enter <strong>Bismark</strong> (2011), which automated the entire pipeline. But Bismark didn’t just automate existing manual steps—it introduced <strong>abstraction</strong>: the tool could handle single-end or paired-end reads, different reference genomes, various quality filters. One algorithm, many applications.</p> <hr> <h2 id="pattern-recognition-the-chromatin-accessibility-revolution">Pattern Recognition: The Chromatin Accessibility Revolution</h2> <p>Fast forward to 2013. Jason Buenrostro at Stanford develops ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing). Instead of asking “where is DNA methylated?”, he asks “where is chromatin accessible?”</p> <p>The experimental approach is elegantly simple: a hyperactive transposase (Tn5) cuts DNA at accessible regions and simultaneously inserts sequencing adapters. Sequence the fragments, and you have a map of open chromatin.</p> <p>But here’s where <strong>pattern recognition</strong> becomes crucial. ATAC-seq doesn’t just give you a list of open regions. It gives you:</p> <ul> <li>Read depth (how accessible is each region?)</li> <li>Fragment length distribution (are nucleosomes present?)</li> <li>Footprints (protected regions within accessible chromatin where transcription factors bind)</li> </ul> <div class="alert alert-success" role="alert"> <p><strong>Pattern Recognition in Action:</strong> Early ATAC-seq papers just counted peaks. Then researchers noticed patterns: certain genomic regions showed stereotypical fragment length distributions. A peak with many ~40-50bp fragments suggested nucleosome-free regions. Longer fragments (~200bp) indicated mononucleosomes.</p> </div> <p>By 2016, tools like <strong>NucleoATAC</strong> were extracting nucleosome positioning and transcription factor occupancy from the same ATAC-seq data, because the patterns were there all along—they just needed algorithms to recognize them systematically.</p> <p>The key insight: ATAC-seq fragment lengths aren’t noise. They’re data. But recognizing that required thinking computationally about what the experimental readout was actually telling you.</p> <hr> <h2 id="algorithmic-thinking-chip-seq-and-the-peak-calling-problem">Algorithmic Thinking: ChIP-seq and the Peak Calling Problem</h2> <p>Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) gives you a pile of DNA fragments representing where your protein of interest was bound. Your challenge: where, exactly, were the binding sites?</p> <p>This is an <strong>algorithmic thinking</strong> problem: given noisy data with background signal, how do you systematically identify true binding events?</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <div class="card"> <div class="card-body"> <h5 class="card-title text-danger">❌ Naive Algorithm</h5> <ol> <li>Align reads to genome</li> <li>Count reads in sliding windows</li> <li>Call regions with high counts as "peaks"</li> <li>Done</li> </ol> <p class="card-text"><small class="text-muted">What early researchers did manually</small></p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <div class="card border-success"> <div class="card-body"> <h5 class="card-title text-success">✓ Sophisticated Algorithm (MACS2)</h5> <ol> <li>Model local background using control samples</li> <li>Shift reads to estimate fragment centers</li> <li>Use dynamic lambda (local background rate)</li> <li>Calculate fold enrichment and statistical significance</li> <li>Call peaks using FDR cutoff</li> <li>Report peak summits, not just regions</li> </ol> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p>Notice the difference?
