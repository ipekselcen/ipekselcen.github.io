**Hi, Iâ€™m Ipek.** Iâ€™m a molecular biologist exploring **epigenetics**, **cloning**, and **computational (bioinformatics) tools**.
This site is my **motivation hub**: I share projects Iâ€™m building and short notes on what Iâ€™m learning.

- **Current focus:** RNA/epigenetic regulation, analysis pipelines (R/Bioconductor, Python), and translating complex results into clear writing.
- **Career interests:** Molecular biology R&D, bioinformatics, and scientific editorial work.
