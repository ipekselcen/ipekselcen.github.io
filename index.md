**Hi, I am Ipek.** I am a molecular biologist exploring epigenetics and bioinformatics tools.
This site is my *motivation hub*: I share projects I am building and short notes on what I am learning.

- **Current focus:** RNA/epigenetic regulation, analysis pipelines, and translating complex results into clear writing.
- **Career interests:** Molecular biology R&D, bioinformatics, and scientific editorial work.
